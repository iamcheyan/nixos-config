# Only a same-repository PR into a release branch that leaves the dependency
# set and toolchain alone. A change to Cargo.lock, Cargo.toml or
# rust-toolchain.toml changes what gets compiled in, so its rebuild stays a
# human step: someone reads that diff before the bytes are committed.
#
# Reads GITHUB_EVENT_NAME, GITHUB_BASE_REF, IS_FORK and ACTOR from the
# environment; needs the base branch fetched (checkout with fetch-depth: 0).
#
# CI runs the base branch's copy (`git show origin/<base>:<this path> | bash`),
# so a change here takes effect for pull requests opened after it merges.
