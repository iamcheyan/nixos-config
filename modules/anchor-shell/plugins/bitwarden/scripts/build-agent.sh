#
#   Cargo.lock              the exact dependency set          (committed, per package)
#   rust-toolchain.toml     the exact compiler                (committed, per package,
#                                                              and the same in each)
#   --target                the ABI                           (below)

#   the container image     glibc, ld and strip               (PINNED_IMAGE)
#
# The image matters because glibc symbol versions and `strip` output change
# with the host. rustc embeds no timestamp (so no SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH), and no git
# commit is embedded: a binary cannot name the commit that tracks it.

Usage: scripts/build-agent.sh [--verify-reproducible] [--compare-tracked]
                              [--ci] [--allow-unpinned] [--explain]

  (no flags)            Build every release helper into bin/<arch>/ and write
                        bin/SHA256SUMS.
  --verify-reproducible Build twice from two different absolute paths and
                        require byte-identical output. Writes nothing.
  --compare-tracked     Report whether every tracked binary matches a fresh
                        build of this source, without modifying the repository.
                        Exit 1 on drift, including a binary not yet tracked.
  --ci                  All three from two builds, as CI runs them: build twice
                        and require identical output, report whether every
                        tracked binary matches, then write the build to bin/
                        and bin/SHA256SUMS as the candidate. Exit 1 if the
                        builds differ or fail, 3 if they agree but the tracked
                        binaries drifted (the candidate is written either way).
  --allow-unpinned      Permit a host-toolchain build when no container runtime
                        is available. The result is NOT reproducible and is
                        refused by --verify-reproducible.
  --explain             Say which build environment this would use and stop.
                        Runs nothing, pulls nothing, writes nothing.
