![Bitwarden Vault Plugin preview](preview.png)

Built on Quickshell and the official Bitwarden CLI. Keyboard-first, fast, and
it never writes your vault to a cache of its own.

---

## Install

One command. It clones the plugin, enables it, and puts it in the bar:

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Elevate08/qs-bitwarden-cli --enable
```

Nothing else has to be installed first. Open the panel and it tells you what it
still needs -- on a stock Omarchy install that is the Bitwarden CLI and `jq` --
with an **Install** button that hands off to Omarchy's own installer.

To update: `omarchy plugin update io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli`

### Sign in

<img src="docs/screenshots/12-login.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Login screen">

Email and password, with the 2FA prompt appearing only when Bitwarden asks for
one. **Server region** picks US, EU, or a custom URL for self-hosted Bitwarden
and Vaultwarden.

Using SSO, a Duo push, or a hardware key? **Launch Terminal** runs `bw login` in
a real terminal so Bitwarden's own prompts handle it, then hands the session
straight back to the panel -- no second login just to get in.

## The tour

### Your vault, one keystroke away

<img src="docs/screenshots/01-vault-list.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Vault list">

Search by name, username, URL, public key or fingerprint. <kbd>Enter</kbd>
copies the password and arms the TOTP follow-up; press it again within the
window and the live 2FA code replaces it on the clipboard.

Items show their folder and organization inline. The bottom bar filters by
folder, organization and type without leaving the keyboard.

**Suggestions** read the focused window or browser tab and pin the matching
credential to the top, so <kbd>Enter</kbd> is usually the only key you need.
Picking an item remembers it for the site's domain or the app; for a site
whose title names neither, pin it with **Suggest here** (only a pin learns a
title's words, so a look-alike title cannot borrow a real site's login).

Suggestions come from the window **title**, because that is all Hyprland
exposes -- not the tab's real address. A page chooses its own title, so a
phishing page titled `github.com` is suggested your GitHub login just like
the real one. Check the address bar before you paste; unlike browser
autofill, this is no defence against a look-alike site.

<br clear="all">

<img src="docs/screenshots/06-folder-drawer.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Folder filter drawer">

<kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>o</kbd> and <kbd>t</kbd> open the folder, organization and
type drawers. Arrows move, <kbd>Enter</kbd> applies, <kbd>Esc</kbd> closes --
and the cursor starts on the option already in effect, so <kbd>Enter</kbd>
never changes anything by accident.

<br clear="all">

### Open an item

<img src="docs/screenshots/02-login-detail.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Login detail">

Username, password and the live TOTP with its countdown, the websites attached
to the item, its notes and any custom fields. Copy any of them with one key.
An item marked **Master password re-prompt** asks for your master password
before anything secret of it is shown, copied or edited.

**Suggest here** pins this item for the app or site in front of you, so it is
offered outright next time rather than inferred.

<br clear="all">

### Every item type, not just logins

<img src="docs/screenshots/04-card-detail.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Card detail">

**Cards** show cardholder, brand, number, expiry and security code. The number
and the code are masked until revealed, and each reveals independently -- an eye
is a statement about the field it sits on.

Search finds a card by brand, cardholder, or last four digits. Deliberately not
by the middle of a number.

<br clear="all">

<img src="docs/screenshots/05-identity-detail.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Identity detail">

**Identities** show name, username, company, email and phone, the social
security, passport and licence numbers, and the address as a single copyable
block rather than seven rows. Empty fields are not drawn, so a sparse identity
stays short.

The three identifiers are masked for the reason a password is, with the
difference that these cannot be rotated afterwards.

<br clear="all">

### Add and edit, without waiting

<img src="docs/screenshots/03-edit-item.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Edit item form">

Create logins, secure notes, cards and identities. <kbd>Enter</kbd> saves from
anywhere in the form, so a long item does not have to be scrolled to the bottom.

Saving and deleting no longer hold the panel. The form closes as the command is
launched and the row shows a spinner until the vault answers. If the vault
refuses, the list goes straight back to what it actually holds and offers to
reopen what you typed.

<br clear="all">

### Generator

<img src="docs/screenshots/08-generator.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Password generator">

Every option the browser extension has -- length, character classes, minimums,
ambiguous characters, or a passphrase with a word count and separator -- with a
live strength meter.

Generation comes from Bitwarden's own generator, not a reimplementation, and
answers in about **2ms** rather than the ~2.9s a fresh `bw generate` costs.

<br clear="all">

### Send

<img src="docs/screenshots/09-sends.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Bitwarden Send">

Share a secret through a link that expires on its own, so a credential need not
live in a chat log. Set a deletion window, a view limit and an optional
password; the link is copied the moment it is created.

<br clear="all">

### SSH agent

<img src="docs/screenshots/13-ssh-approval.png" width="420" align="right" alt="SSH signing approval">

Opt-in. Serves the SSH keys in your vault to `ssh`, Git and `ssh-keygen -Y sign`
while the vault is unlocked, from a helper process that holds the private keys
in memory -- never on disk, never in QML.

Every signature says what is being signed and names the key, its fingerprint
and the program asking. One approval can cover a whole rebase -- and only the
rebase's signatures; live grants are listed and revocable.

**[Setup, verification and threat model →](docs/ssh-agent.md)**

<br clear="all">

### Settings

<img src="docs/screenshots/10-settings.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Settings screen">

Grouped into **General**, **Security** and **SSH Agent**, with the section you
are reading pinned above the list as you scroll. Destructive actions sit under
their own **DANGER ZONE** heading.

Changes are written to the plugin's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`
through `omarchy bar set`, so Omarchy owns the file and the shell hot-reloads.

The General settings include **Colorize menu-bar icon**, which makes the
primary Bitwarden shield follow the active Omarchy theme accent. It is off by
default; lock and setup/error indicators keep their existing status colors.

[^cli-json]: The CLI creates a login by default; other types need the JSON
    edited before encoding, as its documentation describes -- "use a
    command-line JSON processor like jq to change a `.type=` attribute to
    create other item types."
[^adr]: **This plugin** will not. The CLI can encrypt a type-5 item, but
    generating a key means putting private material somewhere this plugin has
    deliberately kept it out of.
[^ssh-clients]: Bitwarden documents SSH keys as generated or imported "using
    the desktop app, web app, and browser extension", and generation is
    Ed25519 only.
[^ssh-desktop]: Bitwarden's SSH agent is a desktop-app feature; the CLI does
    not provide one.
[^pin]: PIN unlock is documented for "mobile apps, browser extensions, and
    desktop apps".
[^fp]: **This plugin** verifies through the same PAM stack as the Omarchy lock
    screen, so it works wherever `omarchy setup security fingerprint` has been
    run.
[^bio]: Biometric unlock is documented for the desktop app, browser extensions
    and mobile apps -- not the CLI.
[^bio-linux]: On Linux the desktop app's biometric unlock goes through a polkit
    agent rather than a fingerprint reader directly.
[^fido]: **This plugin** asks the key for its `hmac-secret` on the
    registration `omarchy setup security fido2` writes, and that secret opens
    the stored password -- so unlocking needs the key, not only a touch. No
    Bitwarden client offers FIDO2 unlock, so there is no upstream column to
    match.
[^totp]: All three read TOTP codes -- `bw get totp` on the CLI. The check
    here is for the follow-up: <kbd>Enter</kbd> copies the password and then
    replaces it with the live code a few seconds later, so a login and its
    second factor are one keystroke apart.
[^cli-lock]: The CLI has `bw lock`, but no timeout of its own -- a session key
    stays valid until something locks it.
[^desk-lock]: The desktop app offers time passed, on system idle, on system
    sleep, on system lock and on restart.

[^io]: `bw import` and `bw export` on the CLI; the desktop app has both in its
    UI. This plugin has neither -- it reads and writes single items, and a
    vault export is a different kind of operation from the one it is for.
[^trash]: A delete here is a delete. Bitwarden keeps deleted items in a trash
    for 30 days and both official clients can restore from it (`bw restore`);
    this plugin shows no trash and cannot restore.
[^attach]: This plugin downloads attachments but cannot add one. The CLI has
    `bw create attachment --file`.
[^filesend]: This plugin creates text Sends only. Both official clients send
    files too -- `bw send -f <path>`.
[^fields]: Text, hidden, boolean and linked fields follow the same type model
    as Bitwarden's browser extension. Secure Notes have no linked native field,
    so the linked type is offered only for logins, cards and identities.
[^orgadmin]: `bw confirm` and `bw device-approval` are CLI features; the
    desktop app does not do this either, and it is otherwise the web vault's
    job. Listed because the CLI is genuinely ahead of both here.

## Usage & Keyboard Shortcuts

The panel opens with the item list focused, so single-letter shortcuts work straight away. Press <kbd>/</kbd> to type a search.

**While the search box has focus** every letter is search text -- as a text field should behave. Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to reach the same shortcuts without leaving the box or disturbing your query; <kbd>↓</kbd> also hands focus back to the list.

### Vault List View (Main Screen)

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Copy password (and arm the TOTP follow-up), or open the item when there is no password to copy -- a card, an identity, a note, an SSH key |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> *(again)* | Copy the TOTP code during the follow-up window |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> / <kbd>j</kbd> / <kbd>k</kbd> | Move through items, or through an open filter drawer |
| <kbd>/</kbd> | Focus the search box |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> | Cycle types without opening the drawer |
| <kbd>p</kbd> *(or <kbd>y</kbd>)* | Copy **p**assword |
| <kbd>u</kbd> *(or <kbd>c</kbd>)* | Copy **u**sername / email |
| <kbd>m</kbd> | Copy TOTP **m**ulti-factor code |
| <kbd>w</kbd> | Open the **w**ebsite in your browser |
| <kbd>e</kbd> | Open the detail inspector / **e**dit |
| <kbd>f</kbd> | **F**olders filter |
| <kbd>o</kbd> | **O**rganizations filter |
| <kbd>t</kbd> | **T**ypes filter |
| <kbd>g</kbd> | **G**enerator |
| <kbd>n</kbd> | **N**ew vault item |
| <kbd>s</kbd> | **S**ettings |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Sync (**r**efresh) |
| <kbd>l</kbd> | **L**ock the vault |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> | Bitwarden **S**end |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> | Settings |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> | **A**ccounts: switch to another account, or add one |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Close the filter drawer, clear the search, or close the panel |

`Alt` + any letter above runs the same action from inside the search box. Three are `Alt`-only: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> opens **Send** (which has no bare letter, since <kbd>s</kbd> is Settings), <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> opens **Settings**, so Settings is still reachable while searching, and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> opens **Accounts**.

### Detail Inspector

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> / <kbd>y</kbd> / <kbd>p</kbd> | Copy what the item is for: the password on a login, the number on a card |
| <kbd>u</kbd> / <kbd>c</kbd> | Copy username; on an identity <kbd>u</kbd> is the username and <kbd>c</kbd> the email |
| <kbd>n</kbd> | Copy a card's **n**umber |
| <kbd>k</kbd> | Copy a card's security code |
| <kbd>m</kbd> | Copy TOTP code |
| <kbd>v</kbd> | Toggle re**v**eal on the item's principal secret -- the password on a login, the number on a card. Every other masked field has its own eye, and each reveals independently |
| <kbd>a</kbd> | Save every **a**ttachment on this item |
| <kbd>e</kbd> | Edit this item |
| <kbd>x</kbd> | Delete this item (asks first) |
| <kbd>b</kbd> / <kbd>q</kbd> / <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Back to the list |

### Filter Drawer (Folders / Organizations / Types)

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| <kbd>f</kbd> / <kbd>o</kbd> / <kbd>t</kbd> | Open (or close) that drawer |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> | Move through the options |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Apply the highlighted option |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Close without changing anything |

The cursor starts on the option already in effect, so <kbd>Enter</kbd> never changes a filter by accident.

### Settings Screen

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> / <kbd>↓</kbd> | Move between settings |
| <kbd>←</kbd> / <kbd>→</kbd> | Decrease / increase a number by its step, or switch a toggle off / on |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Flip the highlighted toggle, or open the PIN / fingerprint form |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Back |

### Send Screen

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> | Open Sends |
| <kbd>n</kbd> | New Send |
| <kbd>r</kbd> | Refresh the list |
| <kbd>x</kbd> | Delete the highlighted Send |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Copy the highlighted Send's link |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Back |

## Optional features

### Several accounts

<img src="docs/screenshots/14-accounts.png" width="420" align="right" alt="Account list">

The panel can hold up to ten Bitwarden accounts at once -- a personal and a work account, say, or two servers. Press **Add Account** on the locked screen (or the account button in the header) and sign in; the first account stays signed in beside it. **Switch Account** on the locked screen, or the header's account button, lists them.

- **Each account keeps its own sign-in and its own quick unlock.** A PIN, fingerprint or FIDO2 key set up for one account is that account's; switching never asks you to log in again or set anything up again. The same fingerprint or key can unlock every account -- nothing is re-enrolled, each account's stored password just gets its own way in.
- **Only one account is unlocked at a time.** Switching locks the one you leave, drops its items from memory and tells the SSH agent, then shows the lock screen of the one you picked, with its unlock methods ready.
- **Log Out** signs out of the account on screen only, deletes its stored password and learned suggestions, and moves to the next account. The others are untouched.
- The quick-unlock settings are shared switches: turning PIN, fingerprint or FIDO2 unlock off in settings removes it from every account.

The first account lives where a terminal `bw` finds it (`~/.config/Bitwarden CLI`), exactly as before. Each account added beside it gets a private directory of its own under `~/.local/share/qs-bitwarden-cli/accounts/`, which `bw` is pointed at with `BITWARDENCLI_APPDATA_DIR`; the list of accounts (emails and servers, nothing secret) is `registry.json` in the same place. Upgrading needs nothing: your current account becomes the first one, with everything it had.

### How your vault is held

While your vault is open, its session key and every item's secrets are held by a small helper process (`bin/x86_64-linux/qs-bitwarden-vault`), not by the shell. If the shell crashes, the core dump systemd keeps has no session key and no passwords in it, and the shell's own crash dumps still work for diagnosing it. A password you copy goes from the helper straight to the clipboard; TOTP codes and search are answered by the helper too. It talks only to the shell that started it, on its stdin and stdout.

It ships and is verified like the other helpers. If it is missing or fails its check, the panel works as before, with the vault held in the shell, and a banner says crash protection is off. **[How it works and what it does not cover →](docs/vault-helper.md)**

### How quick unlock stores your password

PIN, fingerprint and FIDO2 unlock all need your master password, because `bw unlock` accepts nothing else. The plugin keeps it **once** per account, in a single keyring item (`service=qs-bitwarden-cli, account=unlock_envelope`, or `unlock_envelope@<slot>` for an account added beside the first):

- The first time `bw` accepts a password you typed -- a login, or unlocking with your master password -- it is encrypted under a random key with XChaCha20-Poly1305, and the whole item is sealed to this machine and your user with `systemd-creds --user`. A copy taken off this machine is useless.
- Each unlock method you turn on adds its own way to that one key, and none of them stores the password again. Turning a method off in settings removes only its way in -- from every account, since the switch is shared -- and one turned off in `shell.json` while the shell was not running is removed at the next start.
- The master password you are asked for when turning a method on is a **check** against the stored one, not a new copy: a wrong one is refused, and nothing you type there is stored.
- If you change your master password elsewhere, the next unlock with the new one re-seals the stored copy and keeps every method.
- Logging out of an account deletes its copy; other accounts keep theirs.

The small helper that does the encryption (`bin/x86_64-linux/qs-bitwarden-unlock-key`) ships and is verified exactly like the SSH helper; if it is missing or fails its check, quick unlock is unavailable and your master password still works. Everything else is the operating system: `argon2`, `systemd-creds`, `fido2-assert` and `secret-tool`.

An earlier build could store this item across several lines, which makes gnome-keyring refuse Omarchy's passwordless default keyring at the next login (apps ask you to create a new keyring, and the journal says `keyring was in an invalid or unrecognized format`). The plugin repairs this on its own each time it starts: an item the keyring still serves is stored again on one line, and a keyring file already refused has the item joined back onto one line in place, with the original kept beside it as `Default_keyring.keyring.before-repair-<time>`. A notification then asks you to restart the computer (Omarchy has no logout), which loads the collection cleanly. To do it by hand, run `scripts/repair-keyring.sh` from the plugin's directory (`--check` only reports). Nothing else in the keyring is changed, and no secret is printed.

Upgrading from 1.10.0 or earlier needs nothing from you. The old entries -- a plaintext copy for fingerprint and for FIDO2, an encrypted one for the PIN -- are moved in as each method is next used, and deleted once the new copy opens.

**The honest limit.** The stored password is only as protected as the weakest method you have turned on, and the settings screen says so. The seal ties the stored item to this machine and this user, so a copy taken elsewhere is useless -- but a program running as you can unseal it here (`systemd-creds --user decrypt`). With fingerprint unlock on, that is all it needs: a fingerprint releases no secret to encrypt with. With a PIN, it can then guess the PIN offline, at its own pace and on every core (see [PIN unlock](#pin-unlock)). A FIDO2 key cannot be bypassed that way, because the key itself produces the secret; root, as always, can read anything.

### PIN unlock

Turn on **Unlock with PIN** in the settings screen. Confirm your master password and choose a PIN of **at least 6 digits; 8 or more is the recommendation**. Six and seven are accepted but shown with the real cost of guessing them, so a weak PIN is a decision rather than an accident. (A PIN set with an older version, when 4 was the floor, still unlocks; set a new one to get the longer PIN.)

The PIN reaches the stored password through **Argon2id** (256 MiB of memory, 4 passes), from the OS `argon2` tool. That cost is the whole defence against guessing: a program running as you can copy the stored item, unseal it and try PINs offline on every core. Measured on a 16-thread laptop, one guess takes about 0.46 s and 16 in parallel make about 17 a second, so every PIN of **6 digits falls in about 16 hours, 7 digits in about 7 days, and 8 digits in about 2 months** (4 digits took about 10 minutes, which is why it is no longer allowed). A wrong PIN always fails -- the encryption is authenticated, so there is no "decrypts to garbage" case.

Five wrong attempts at the panel removes the PIN's way in, and turning it back on needs your master password. That limit applies only to guesses typed into the panel's own screen, not to a copy of the stored item; the Argon2 cost is what stands behind it.

### Fingerprint unlock

Set `fingerprintUnlock` to `true` to unlock the vault with a finger instead of your master password.

**Requirements**

- A fingerprint reader with at least one enrolled finger, configured through `omarchy setup security fingerprint`. The plugin verifies all of this itself (`/etc/pam.d/omarchy-lock-fingerprint`, `fprintd-list`) and silently stays hidden when any part is missing.
- A running, unlocked OS keyring, as used by `rememberSession`. Omarchy ships libsecret itself, so there is nothing to install for this.

**How it works**

1. Switch **Unlock with fingerprint** on in the settings screen and confirm your master password.
2. On every later lock, opening the panel arms the reader. A verified fingerprint opens the stored password for `bw unlock`; the password field remains available as a fallback at all times.

**Security trade-off -- read before enabling**

PAM can prove that you are present, but a fingerprint releases no secret, so it cannot encrypt anything by itself. Fingerprint unlock is the one method whose way in is protected only by the machine seal, which means **a program running as you while you are logged in can open the stored password without your finger**. This is the same trade the official Bitwarden desktop client makes for its own biometric unlock. It is off by default and worth leaving off on a shared or unattended machine -- and with it on, a PIN or a key does not make the stored password any safer.

Its way in is removed when you turn the setting off or log out -- for the account on screen; other accounts keep theirs.

**A closed lid takes the option off the screen.** The reader is on the laptop body, so with the lid shut -- clamshell mode, or simply closed on a docked machine -- there is nothing to touch. While it is down, the locked screen hides **Unlock with Fingerprint**, the SSH prompt does the same, and the reader is not armed on open. Omarchy's own detector (`omarchy-hw-laptop-closed`) decides, and a machine with no lid never reports one. Nothing is forgotten: the settings toggle is unchanged, and the option is back the moment the lid opens. A FIDO2 key on a cable is unaffected.

### FIDO2 key unlock

Set `fidoUnlock` to `true` to unlock the vault with a FIDO2 authenticator (a YubiKey or any other compliant key) instead of your master password.

**Requirements**

- A FIDO2 key registered through `omarchy setup security fido2`. That one command detects the key, installs `libfido2`/`pam-u2f`, registers it, and wires it for the system's own authentication prompts; the plugin uses that same registration (`/etc/fido2/fido2`) and offers the command itself when no key is registered yet. The option stays hidden on a machine with no key.
- A key that supports the `hmac-secret` extension, which current YubiKeys and most FIDO2 keys do.

**How it works**

1. Switch **Unlock with FIDO2 key** on in the settings screen. If no key is registered, it first hands off to `omarchy setup security fido2`; otherwise confirm your master password and touch the key once.
2. On every later lock, opening the panel arms the key if one is plugged in (falling back to the fingerprint reader otherwise). One touch asks the key for a secret only it can produce -- its `hmac-secret` for the registered credential -- and that secret opens the stored password. The password field remains available as a fallback at all times.

The key will not produce that secret without a touch, so unlocking needs the key itself, not just a program able to read your keyring. Each registered key that is plugged in when you turn the option on gets its own way in, so a backup key works too.

Registrations made with `+pin` or `+verification` (a key PIN at every system prompt) are not used: the panel cannot collect the key's PIN yet, and a touch alone would be weaker than what the registration asks of the system.

Its way in is removed when you turn the setting off or log out -- for the account on screen; other accounts keep theirs. `omarchy remove security fido2` unregisters the key for the system's own authentication prompts as well, which is why the plugin points at Omarchy's setup rather than registering the key itself.

### SSH agent

Off by default. See **[docs/ssh-agent.md](docs/ssh-agent.md)** for setup, the
provenance check, and what the agent does and does not protect.

## Bar placement

`--enable` already puts the widget in the bar. To move it:

```bash
omarchy bar move io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli --section right
```

Settings are editable from the panel's own settings screen, or directly in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`. Each setting lives **inline on the bar entry**,
not in a separate block:

```json

## Global hotkey

To toggle the Bitwarden panel with a keyboard shortcut (e.g. `SUPER + CTRL + /`), add the binding to `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua`:

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + CTRL + SLASH", "Bitwarden vault", "omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli toggle")
```

Apply changes by restarting the shell:

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

## Configuration Reference

The following settings are read from the plugin's own entry in the
`bar.layout` array of `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json` -- inline alongside its
`id`, as shown above. The panel's settings screen writes them for you via
`omarchy bar set`, so editing the file by hand is optional:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `autoLockMinutes` | `number` | `15` | Minutes of inactivity before automatically locking the vault (`0` to disable). Range `0`-`1440`; out of range is clamped and an unreadable value falls back to `15`. |
| `clearClipboardSec` | `number` | `30` | Seconds before automatically clearing copied secrets from the clipboard (`0` to disable). The clear is the copy's own lifetime (`wl-copy` under `timeout`), so it survives a shell restart and never touches something copied later. Range `0`-`300`; out of range is clamped and an unreadable value falls back to `30`. |
| `lockOnScreenLock` | `boolean` | `true` | Lock the vault as soon as the screen locks, rather than waiting out `autoLockMinutes`. Reads the Omarchy lock screen's own state, so it follows a manual lock and an idle lock alike. A shell without the lock plugin simply never reports a lock; it is never read as one. |
| `lockOnSuspend` | `boolean` | `true` | Lock the vault when the machine is going to sleep, so no unlocked session key is left in the suspended machine's memory. Holds a `delay` sleep inhibitor until `bw lock` and the keyring clear have finished, at most 4 seconds. Needs `gdbus` (glib2), `systemd-inhibit` and `setsid` (util-linux). The monitor and its children stop when the plugin unloads; without these tools the setting is inert. |
| `rememberSession` | `boolean` | `true` | Persist session token in OS keyring (`secret-tool`) while unlocked. Survives a shell restart, never a reboot -- see the note above. Turning it off removes a stored session at once, and with it off an unload while unlocked runs `bw lock`. |
| `autoCopyTotpSec` | `number` | `3` | Seconds after password copy to automatically replace clipboard with TOTP code (`0` to disable). Range `0`-`30`; out of range is clamped and an unreadable value falls back to `3`. |
| `closeOnCopy` | `boolean` | `true` | Automatically close panel on Enter copy so target application receives focus immediately. |
| `suggestOnOpen` | `boolean` | `true` | Automatically suggest matching vault items for the active window or browser tab on open. |
| `fingerprintUnlock` | `boolean` | `false` | Unlock the vault with an enrolled fingerprint. Adds a way into the one encrypted stored password -- see [Fingerprint unlock](#fingerprint-unlock) for its limit. |
| `fidoUnlock` | `boolean` | `false` | Unlock the vault with a FIDO2 authenticator, on the registration `omarchy setup security fido2` writes. The key's `hmac-secret` opens the stored password -- see [FIDO2 key unlock](#fido2-key-unlock). |
| `pinUnlock` | `boolean` | `false` | Unlock with a numeric PIN of at least 6 digits, through Argon2id -- see [PIN unlock](#pin-unlock). |
| `sshAgentEnabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Serve your vault's SSH keys to `ssh`, Git and signing while the vault is unlocked. Starts a helper process and a socket under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`; private keys stay in that helper and are dropped on lock -- see [SSH Agent](docs/ssh-agent.md). |
| `sshAgentUnlockOnDemand` | `boolean` | `false` | Let an identity listing raise the unlock prompt when the vault is locked and no keys have been loaded yet, instead of answering with an empty list. Signing a key the helper already knows always raises the prompt, with or without this. Off by default: `ssh` asks the agent for identities on every connection, so this raises the configured approval surface on the first `ssh` after every login. |
| `sshAgentApprovalPopup` | `boolean` | `true` | Show SSH unlock and signing requests in a transient card in the middle of the screen instead of opening the anchored panel. Disable to show prompts in the panel. Multiple concurrent requests are queued sequentially with a "1 of N" counter and "Deny all" option. Escape and outside click deny. |
| `sshAgentApprovalWindowSec` | `number` | `120` | How long one approval keeps covering further signatures from the same program with the same key. Range `0`-`900`; `0` asks every time. Held in memory only and dropped on lock, logout or exit. |

One further key, `twoFactorMethods`, is written to the same entry but is not a
setting you configure. It records which two-step method last logged each
account in, keyed by login address -- `{"you@example.com": 0}`, where `0` is
authenticator, `1` email and `3` YubiKey -- so an account with more than one
method is asked only once, and two vaults on one machine each keep their own
answer. **Change method** on the code screen asks again and rewrites it. Entries
are capped at ten accounts, and anything unreadable is treated as not
remembered, which costs that account one extra prompt.

Learned suggestions are stored separately in `~/.local/state/qs-bitwarden-cli/associations.json`. Delete that file to reset everything the panel has learned; logging out deletes it for you.

## Multiple monitors

Omarchy draws its bar once per monitor, so the widget appears on every one of
them -- but there is one vault behind them all:

- Unlocking or locking on any monitor applies to all of them, and every bar's
  icon shows the same state.
- The panel opens on the monitor whose icon you click, and moving to another
  monitor's icon moves the open panel there, where you left it. A keyboard
  summon lands on the focused monitor, or on the panel if it is already open.
- There is one SSH agent, one sleep inhibitor and one IPC target however many
  monitors are attached. A signing request appears on the monitor with the open
  panel, or otherwise the focused one.
- Unplugging a monitor, even the one showing the panel, leaves the vault and the
  agent running.

If something else on the machine is already serving the agent's socket -- a
second Omarchy shell, for example -- the SSH agent settings say so and wait for
it to stop, rather than reporting a helper that keeps failing to start.

A bar other than Omarchy's own cannot share one vault between its copies, so on
a replacement bar each monitor's widget keeps a vault of its own, as before.

## IPC & Scripting Interface

You can control and query the Bitwarden plugin from the terminal, scripts, or window manager bindings. The form is `omarchy-shell <target> <method>`:

```bash
# Show, hide, or toggle the popup panel
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli open
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli close
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli toggle

# Jump straight to a screen
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli settings     # -> "settings"
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli setup        # -> "setup" (dependency wizard)

# Lock the vault immediately
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli lock         # -> "locked"

# Sync with Bitwarden
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli sync         # -> "syncing"

# Query vault state
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli status       # -> "unlocked" | "locked" | "unauthenticated"

# Which vault the bars share, and which monitor presents it (non-secret)
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli vaultHost    # -> {"host":"shared","views":2,"presenter":"DP-1",...}

# The accounts the panel holds (emails and servers only), and switching to one;
# switching locks the account active now
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli accounts     # -> {"adding":false,"accounts":[{"email":"you@example.com","server":"","active":true}]}
omarchy-shell io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli switchAccount work@example.com   # -> "switching" | "unknown" | "busy"
```

`open`, `close` and `toggle` return nothing; the rest echo the state they moved to.

Omarchy's shell-level dispatcher also toggles any plugin, and works equally well for a keybinding:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell toggle io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli
```

Only `toggle` exists at that level, though -- `omarchy-shell shell open|close <id>` answers `Function not found`, and `omarchy-shell shell call <id> <method> '{}'` answers `unknown`. Use the plugin-target form above for everything other than toggling.

The same calls work through Quickshell directly, which is useful when `omarchy-shell` is not on `PATH`:

```bash
qs -p /usr/share/omarchy/shell/shell.qml ipc call io.github.elevate08.qs-bitwarden-cli status
```

## Dependencies

The helper's crates are updated by Dependabot under `versioning-strategy:
lockfile-only`, so a proposed bump only ever moves `agent/Cargo.lock` within
the bounds `agent/Cargo.toml` already allows. Crossing a major is a manual
edit, on purpose: several of the version floors in that manifest exist to keep
one copy of the RustCrypto traits in the graph, and Dependabot raising them
one at a time is what broke the build in PR #11.

**The crypto stack moves together or not at all.** `ssh-key` and `rsa`
re-export the trait generation their callers must match, and `agent/src/lib.rs`
calls those traits directly -- `Verifier::verify`, `try_sign`,
`pkcs1v15::SigningKey`. Bump one crate without the others and cargo resolves
two versions side by side, at which point the traits stop unifying and
nothing compiles. The coupled set is `ssh-key`, `ssh-encoding`,
`ed25519-dalek`, `rsa`, `signature`, `sha2`/`digest`, `zeroize` and
`rand_core`; Dependabot groups them under `crypto` for the same reason.

As of 2026-08-31 that upgrade is gated upstream: `ssh-key` is at `0.7.0-rc.11`
and `rsa` at `0.10.0-rc.18`, both still pre-release, and the stable releases
still pin the older generation. When they land, raise every crate in the set
in one commit and expect real source changes, not just a manifest edit.
Nothing will prompt you -- there are no `ignore` conditions to trip, because
cargo's own semver rules already hold `0.10` back from `0.11`.

Every accepted bump, major or not, changes the shipped bytes and so needs the
binary rebuilt in the same change, by hand -- see the `needs-binary-rebuild`
label:

```bash
gh pr checkout <n>
./scripts/build-agent.sh    # re-enters the digest-pinned image
git commit -am "deps: rebuild the agent binary" && git push
```

For other source changes CI does it: on a pull request into a release branch
from this repository, `helper-rebuild.yml` rebuilds the helpers in the pinned
image and commits them to the PR branch. It never does so when `Cargo.lock`,
`Cargo.toml` or `rust-toolchain.toml` changed, or for Dependabot or a fork.
`--compare-tracked` proves the committed bytes are what the committed source
builds; it cannot tell you whether that source is trustworthy, and a malicious
crate builds just as reproducibly as an honest one. Reading the `Cargo.lock`
diff before you commit the binary is the only check that covers that, which
is why dependency rebuilds stay a human step.
